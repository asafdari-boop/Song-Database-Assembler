# Song-Database-Assembler
Useful for assembling training sets of mp3 files for AI/ML music based agents. Personally used to create a music recommendation service using an agent that analyzes the audio makeup of the sound file instead of just looking at the metadata. 

Can be used to download music portfolio of artists or bands as long as a wikipedia discography page exists for them (implying a certain degreee of fame).

To use clone or fork and download the dependecies using pip install -r requirements.txt

Then simply run python dl_video_urls.py and follow prompts
